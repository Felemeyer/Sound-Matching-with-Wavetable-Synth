# Sound-Matching-with-Wavetable-Synth

This repository contains files for perfomring sound matching with ableton's Wavetable synth.

Record Script: Can be used to automatically record an audio dataset of the synthesizer's output. Preset files need to be put into a folder, then accessed via Ableton Live's file browser. The program then iterates through the files in the folder via keyboard inputs (dont touch the pc during recording). It needs midi and audio loopback to work.
